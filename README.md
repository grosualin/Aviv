## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview
The app follows Clean Architecture principles and the MVVM architecture, using Repository pattern.
The app has the following structure and layers:

- Presentation Layer : UI, ViewModels, Models, State (StateFlow, Coroutines)
    - Responsible for displaying data and handling user interactions.
    - Uses usecases to interact with data and maps domain model to ui models.
- Domain Layer: UseCases, Interfaces, Business Models
    - Holds usecases and business models.
    - Responsible for business logic and data processing.
    - A usecase combines one or multiple repositories and performs a specific business operation by implementing business logic.
- Data Layer: Remote (API services, DTOs), Mappers
    - One data source: remote apis
    - Responsible for fetching data.
    - Maps data layer models to domain layer models.
- Dependency Injection Layer: Modules
    - Provides a mechanism for injecting dependencies into classes.
    - Uses Hilt for dependency injection.
    - A module tells Hilt how to provide dependencies to other objects.

## Tech Stack:
- Kotlin 2.2+ 
- Material Design 3
- Flow (reactive data handling)
- Coroutines (asynchronous programming)
- Hilt (dependency injection)
- Jetpack Compose (UI framework)
